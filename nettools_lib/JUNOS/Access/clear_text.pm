#
# clear-text Access Method for the JUNOS::Access object
#
# Here are the mandatory input parameter(s) that are needed to 
# create a connection with the server and optional input parameters 
# that can change the default behavior of the clear-text connection.
#
# $self->{hostname} = Mandatory.  Name of the router to connect to.
#
# $self->{login} = Conditional on noninteractive.  The username to login the server.
# 	If this parameter is not provided by the client application,
# 	this module will prompt for the username unless noninteractive
# 	is specified.
#
# $self->{password} = Conditional on noninteractive.  The password for the username.
# 	If this parameter is not provided by the client
# 	application and it's requested by the server, this
# 	module will prompt for the password unless noninteractive
# 	is specified.
#
# $self->{noninteractive} = Optional.  If this parameter is specified, this module
# 	will not prompt for any information it needs.  Instead,
# 	it will fail if any required information is not already
# 	provided by the client application.  For example, if
# 	the login value is not provided and noninteractive is
# 	specified, then the clear-text connection will fail.
#
# $self->{clear_text_port} = Optional.  The port number of the clear-text server.  It's
# 	JUNOSCRIPT_CLEAR_TEXT_PORT by default.
#
# States maintained by this access method for each clear-text connection, they
# can also be read by the client application:
#
# $self->{xnm_result} = contains the authenticated user if the clear-text
#	connection was successful. Otherwise, it contains the error message.
#
# $self->{clear_text_socket} = the file handle of the socket attached to the clear-text
# 	layer.

=head1 NAME

JUNOS::Access::clear_text - Implements the clear-text access method.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class is used internally to provide clear-text access to a JUNOS::Access
instance.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of JUNOS::Access that manages a clear text session with the destination host.  The underlying mechanics for managing the clear text session is IO::Socket.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

new($ARGS)

See the description of the constructor of the superclass JUNOS::Access.  This class also reads the following clear_text specific keys from the input hash table reference $ARGS.


    clear_text_port			The port number of the clear-text server.
